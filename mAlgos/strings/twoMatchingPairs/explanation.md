# Maximum Matching Pairs

## Problem Statement

Imagine you're a matchmaker setting up pairs for a dance. You have two groups of people, group `s` and group `t`, each with `N` people. Each person in group `s` is paired with a person in group `t` at the same position. A pair is considered a match if the two people have the same name.

However, there's a twist. You're allowed to swap two people within group `s` to try and create more matches. The catch is, you can only do this swap once.

Your task is to find the maximum number of possible matching pairs after making a swap within group `s`. A swap involves switching the positions of two people in group `s`.

In more technical terms, given two strings `s` and `t` of length `N`, find the maximum number of possible matching pairs in strings `s` and `t` after swapping exactly two characters within `s`. A swap is switching `s[i]` and `s[j]`, where `s[i]` and `s[j]` denote the character that is present at the `ith` and `jth` index of `s`, respectively. The matching pairs of the two strings are defined as the number of indices for which `s[i]` and `t[i]` are equal.

Note: You must swap two characters at different indices.

## Examples

### Example 1

`s = "abcd"`
`t = "adcb"`

The output should be `4`.

Explanation: Using 0-based indexing, and with `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `s[1]` and `s[3]` can be swapped, making it  "adcb". Therefore, the number of matching pairs of `s` and `t` will be `4`.

### Example 2

`s = "mno"`
`t = "mno"`

The output should be `1`.

Explanation: Two indices have to be swapped, regardless of which two it is, only one letter will remain the same. If `i = 0` and `j=1`, `s[0]` and `s[1]` are swapped, making `s = "nmo"`, which shares only "o" with `t`.

## Solution Techniques

To solve this problem, you would use a combination of string manipulation, comparison operations, and decision-making logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Counting Matches**: Go through the strings `s` and `t` and count the number of matching pairs. This can be done by comparing the characters at each index of `s` and `t`. If the characters are the same, then it's a match.

2. **Identifying Swap Candidates**: Identify the characters in `s` that could be swapped to increase the number of matches. This involves finding characters in `s` that are not currently a match with `t`, but could be a match if they were in a different position.

3. **Choosing the Best Swap**: Once you've identified potential swap candidates, decide which swap would result in the maximum number of matches. This involves comparing the potential matches that could be gained from each swap and choosing the best one.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Handle the edge case where `s` and `t` are already identical. In this case, swapping any two characters in `s` would actually decrease the number of matches, so you need to account for this in your solution.
